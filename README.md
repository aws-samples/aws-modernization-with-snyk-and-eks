## My Project

In this project, we define the content for the Snyk + Atlassian-themed AWS workshop.  

This workshop is to be delivered by a facilitator, or as a self-service workshop.

## How to run this workshop
If you would like to run this workshop, the process is generally easy.

1. Clone this repository.
1. Download the 0.99.0 binary from the [hugo releases site](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.99.0).
1. Install the files per your operation system (e.g. your favorite package manager)
1. `cd` into the cloned directory (i.e. `cd aws-modernization-with-snyk-and-eks`)
1. In the cloned directory, enter this command `hugo server`

That should be enough for you to see the page available on your local computer at 1localhost:1313`
