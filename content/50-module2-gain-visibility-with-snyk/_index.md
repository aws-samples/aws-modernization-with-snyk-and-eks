# Introduction

At this point, we've recreated an environmnent with a live repository and a working CI/CD pipeline that pushes a container image to Amazon ECR.  This represents a steady-state mode of operation that should be familiar to most teams that build and deploy their software.

In this module, we'll add Snyk to scan the code, open source, and containers in your projects in the same way an existing software team may do the same.

We'll guide you through each step.
