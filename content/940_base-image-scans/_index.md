# Module 2 - Scanning & monitoring container images

![Snyk Bitbucket Flow](../images/snyk-bitbucket-flow-module-02.png)

## Container security[^1]

By 2022, more than [75% of global organizations](https://snyk.io/blog/putting-container-security-in-the-hands-of-developers/) 
will be running containerized applications in production (Gartner). Alongside the widespread adoption, there has been a 
surge in container vulnerabilities, with a 4X increase in reported operating system vulnerabilities in 2018. And yet 
[80% of developers say they don’t test their container images](https://snyk.io/blog/shifting-docker-security-left/) 
during development – it’s either not their responsibility, or they are accustomed to someone down the road catching the 
issues – which makes scaling [container security](https://snyk.io/container-security/) a challenge for fast-growing businesses.

## Learning objective

In this module we will learn how to [secure your build workflow](https://snyk.io/blog/secure-your-build-workflow-on-bitbucket-pipes-with-snyk/) 
on Bitbucket Pipes with Snyk. Scanning and analyzing your Linux-based container project for known vulnerabilities is an 
important step in securing your environment by helping you identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities. The exercises in 
this module will help [secure your container](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003946897-Container-security-overview)
by leveraging the Snyk Pipe for Bitbucket pipelines to scan the base image for its dependencies including:

- The operating system (OS) packages installed and managed by the package manager
- Key binaries—layers that were not installed through the package manager

Based on these results, Snyk will provide fix advice and guidance including:

- Origins of the vulnerabilities in your OS packages and key binaries
- Base image upgrade details or a recommendation to rebuild the image
- Dockerfile layer in which the affected package was introduced
- Fixed-in version of the operating system and key binary packages

Lastly, you will enable Snyk's integration for [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003916078-Configure-integration-for-Amazon-Elastic-Container-Registry-ECR-)
to continuously scan and monitor your container images.
