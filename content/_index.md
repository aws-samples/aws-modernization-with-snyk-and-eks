# AWS Modernization Workshop: DevSecOps with Atlassian & Snyk

![Atlassian and Snyk](images/atlassian-snyk-header.png)

Join [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) and [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) for this hands-on virtual workshop where we will guide 
you on implementing security best-practices early on in your workflow to build an automated and secure 
[Continuous Integration (CI)](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration) & [Continuous Delivery (CD)](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery) pipeline.

## Welcome!

In this workshop, you will pose as the newest member of a Mythical 500 company named __Mythical Mysfits__. It's your first day in the office
and your predecessor(s) hastily (i.e. manually) deployed an "enterprise-ready" piece of software for group collaboration: [goof](https://github.com/snyk/goof). 

According to your colleagues, _goof_ became wildly popular as _"The BESTest todo app evar"_. 

However, you are skeptical. Fortunately, your company also recently purchased Snyk and Atlassian Bitbucket Cloud!

In this workshop, you will leverage [Atlassian Bitbucket](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket), [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines), 
and [Snyk](https://snyk.io) to build and deploy your application with security.  This includes scanning of your container-based workloads running on 
[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) and [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) 
and how to use these patterns to release features and functionality at a faster pace that includes security at each step.
