# AWS Modernization Workshop: DevSecOps with Atlassian & Snyk

![Atlassian and Snyk](images/atlassian-snyk-header.png)

Join [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) and [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) for this hands-on virtual workshop where we will guide 
you on implementing security best-practices early on in your workflow to build an automated and secure 
[Continuous Integration (CI)](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration) & [Continuous Delivery (CD)](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery) pipeline.

## Welcome!

![Mythical Myfits](images/mm.png)

In this workshop, you will pose as the newest member of a Mythical 500 company named __Mythical Mysfits__. It's your first day in the office
and your predecessor(s) hastily (i.e. manually) deployed an "enterprise-ready" piece of software for group collaboration: [goof](https://github.com/snyk/goof). 

According to your colleagues, _goof_ became wildly popular as _"The BESTest todo app evar"_. 

However, you are skeptical. Fortunately, your company also recently purchased Snyk and Atlassian Bitbucket Cloud!

In this workshop, you will leverage [Atlassian Bitbucket](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket), [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines), 
and [Snyk](https://snyk.io) to build and deploy your application with security.  This includes scanning of your container-based workloads running on 
[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) and [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) 
and how to use these patterns to release features and functionality at a faster pace that includes security at each step.

## Learning Objectives

The learning goals of this workshop include:

- Understand [Software Composition Analysis (SCA)](https://snyk.io/blog/what-is-software-composition-analysis-sca-and-does-my-company-need-it/) and its importance in your developer workflows.
- Discover vulnerabilities in your application open source dependencies.
- Implement Snyk's [container image](https://snyk.io/blog/detecting-vulnerabilities-in-container-images/) scanning in your [Continuous integration](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-integration/) and 
[Continuous delivery](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-delivery/) (CI/CD) pipeline.
- [Fix insecure Kubernetes configuration at the source](https://snyk.io/blog/fix-insecure-kubernetes-configuration/).
- Leverage the [Snyk Pipe](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines/integrations?p=snyk/snyk-scan) for Bitbucket Pipelines to secure your application.

## Intended Audience

- Developers
- Security/Application Teams
- DevOps/DevSecOps Engineers
- Cloud/Solutions Architects

## Content Structure

We have structured the various subjects covered in this workshop into specific modules. Each module will provide
context on the theory behind the techniques presented as well as hands-on examples.

### Module 1 - Scanning & monitoring application source code

Enable the Snyk Open Source [integration](https://solutions.snyk.io/snyk-academy/open-source/create-source-control-integration) to Bitbucket and 
[import your SCM project](https://solutions.snyk.io/snyk-academy/open-source/import-scm-project). Understand transitive dependencies and how Snyk can generate automatic pull requests 
to streamline your process.

### Module 2 - Scanning & monitoring container images

Enable Snyk Container [integration](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003916078-Configure-integration-for-Amazon-Elastic-Container-Registry-ECR-) to 
Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and [import](https://solutions.snyk.io/snyk-academy/container/container-registry-and-image-import) your container images. Learn how
Snyk provides base image ugprade recommendations.

### Module 3 - Scanning & monitoring for insecure Kubernetes configurations

[Install the Snyk controller](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360011128137-Install-the-Snyk-controller-on-Amazon-Elastic-Kubernetes-Service-Amazon-EKS-) on 
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and [add workloads for scanning](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003947117-Adding-Kubernetes-workloads-for-security-scanning).
Understand test results, how to interpret Snyk's [Priority Score](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360010906897-Snyk-Priority-Score-and-Kubernetes), and how to 
fix configuration issues.

### Module 4 - Fixing known issues & monitoring

In this module, you will go through guided exercises that demonstrate how to fix for vulnerabilities and insecure configurations. 
You will apply what you learned in the previous modules and apply fixes to your application, container image, and Kubernetes
configuration to secure your application.
