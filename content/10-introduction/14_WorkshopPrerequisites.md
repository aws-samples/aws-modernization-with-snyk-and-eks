This workshop is designed to run as part of an Event where you are given a working environment and led by workshop leaders.  You are also able to run this workshop in a standalone format where you manage all of your environment and setup.

# Workshop Prerequisites
We'll need to setup the following:

- Snyk Account
- Snyk CLI
- Atlassian Bitbucket Cloud with Bitbucket Pipelines

## Snyk Account and Snyk CLI
Your Snyk account allows you to scan your code to see results locally or on the Snyk website.  In this workshop we'll use both the CLI and Website.  You have the additional options of running Snyk within popular IDEs or programmatically with API calls, but those are not covered in this workshop.

## Atlassian Bitbucket Cloud
Your Atlassian Bitbucket Cloud account gives you a place to store your repository and create your working pipeline.  In this workshop, we will use both as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
